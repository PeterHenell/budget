   - Added "Add Category" and "Remove Selected" buttons to budget controls
   - Implemented `add_new_category_row()` method to add categories directly in the budget grid
   - Implemented `remove_selected_category()` method to remove categories from the budget grid
   - Enhanced `load_budget_grid()` to show all categories with their yearly budgets

3. **Improved Transaction Classification**
   - Updated `classify_selected()` to use a dropdown instead of text input
   - Shows available categories for selection during transaction classification
   - Provides better user experience with modal dialog

4. **Code Cleanup**
   - Removed duplicate and obsolete methods
   - Cleaned up old references to category tab components
   - Fixed syntax errors and improved code structure

### Logic Layer Changes (logic.py)

1. **Enhanced Category Removal**
   - Updated `remove_category()` to cascade delete associated budgets
   - Added transaction unassignment when categories are removed
   - Ensures data consistency when categories are deleted

### Key Features

1. **Integrated Category Management**
   - Categories are now managed directly within the budget grid
   - Add new categories by clicking "Add Category" button
   - Remove categories by selecting them in the grid and clicking "Remove Selected"
   - All category operations immediately reflect in the budget view

2. **Improved User Experience**
   - Single location for both category and budget management
   - Streamlined interface with fewer tabs
   - Better visual integration of related functionality

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Proper cascading deletes ensure no orphaned records
   - Transaction classification handles category availability
   - All existing functionality preserved

### Testing

- All 9 existing unit tests continue to pass
- New integration test validates GUI structure and functionality
- Verified category management operations work correctly
- Confirmed proper cleanup of database relationships

### Files Modified

- `gui.py` - Major refactoring to remove Categories tab and integrate functionality
- `logic.py` - Enhanced category removal with cascading operations  
- `test_integration.py` - New integration test to verify changes

The application now has a cleaner, more integrated interface while maintaining all existing functionality for budget management, transaction classification, CSV import, and reporting.
